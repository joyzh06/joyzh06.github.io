    <!-- About Me -->

        <h2>–About Me–</h2>
        <p>In my experience making and playing video games, they represent the epitome of problem solving.</p>
        <p>I have always loved games; it's the reason I decided to study computer science.
            After graduating, I worked as a software engineer for three years. 
            I focused on finding ways to apply the skills and concepts behind game development 
            to other areas of technology and engineering.
        <p>
            Three years later, I finally made the leap to games. I love programming for video games,
            from the frustrations of debugging to the satisfaction of completing a milestone.
            I enjoy the collaborative and the interdisciplinary nature of game development.
            I like being able to constantly see and test the results of my work, and that other people can
            as well to provide player feedback. I am especially interested in gameplay programming.

            <div class="w3-col m6">
                <p>The ultimate home design and building game offering unmatched customization
                    and stunning graphics. Design and construct your dream homes or
                    entire neighborhoods, solo or with friends. Bring your architectural
                    visions to life exactly as you imagine.</p>
                <p>Hometopia is a PC game made in Unity. I joined Hometopia during the
                    6.0 release cycle as a junior developer, and quickly took on more
                    responsibility, until I found myself leading a small team of junior
                    engineers. I was shortly promoted to a senior developer.
                    I made major contributions to the 7.x and 8.x releases.</pp>
                <p>I worked on bug fixing, feature development and improvements,
                    and the multiplayer lobby system. I rewrote the friend list,
                    parties, and chat functionalities. I also improved the process
                    for transfering and sharing multiplayer save files.</p>
                <p>I created an audio system to centralize control of music, ambience, and sound effects.
                    I added an easy way to fade audio in and out, and smoothly switch between tracks.
                    I also added the ability to play one-shot sound effects to make the game more vibrant and immersive.</p>
                <p>I took ownership of UI development, collaborating with the designers
                    to completely overhaul the UI and give the game a cohesive look and feel.
                    Every part of the game’s UI changed, and the work I did included creating a new main menu,
                    reskinning the settings, updating the in-game UI, and redoing the multiplayer UI.
                    I also created a Portfolio where players can view, filter, and sort their saves.
                    They can see additional information for each save, such as the square footage
                    and time spent on the build. They can edit the title, description, and other details.
                    They can also access a photo gallery for each save to view all
                    the screenshots for that build, edit the thumbnail, and share and delete photos.</p>
