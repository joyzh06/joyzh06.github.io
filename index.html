    <!-- About Me -->

        <h2>–About Me–</h2>
        <p>In my experience playing and making video games, they represent the epitome of problem solving.</p>
        <p>I have always loved games; it's the reason I decided to study computer science.
            After graduating, I worked as a general software engineer for three years. 
            I focused on finding ways to apply the skills and concepts behind game development 
            to other areas of technology an engineering.
        <p>
            Three years later, I finally made the leap to games. I love programming for video games,
            from the frustrations of debugging to the satisfaction of completing a milestone.
            I enjoy the collaborative and the interdisciplinary nature of game development.
            I like being able to constantly see and test the results of my work, and that other people can
            as well to provide player feedback. I am especially interested in gameplay programming.

                <p>Hometopia is a PC game made in Unity. I joined Hometopia during the
                    6.0 release cycle as a junior developer, and quickly took on more
                    responsibility, until I found myself leading a small team of junior
                    engineers. I was shortly promoted to a senior developer.
                    I made major contributions to the 7.x and 8.x releases.</pp>
                <p>I worked on bug fixing, feature improvements, and multiplayer. I was also primarily responsible for:
